# Project Description

The main problem we are trying to solve is to have a hassle-free and easy process for common people with cars to make some extra money through their asset while it is not in use. 

We are planning on adding functionalities using HTML/CSS for the front-end and Python Flask for the back-end. We will have various tables in our database such as ***buyer details, car details, payment details, user login, car availability, car ownership and other details***.

The user will have to register an account/login to an existing account before being able to access the rest of the website. Once logged in, the user can choose to either rent a car, in which they can choose from a list of available cars catered to their specific needs, or lease a car, in which the user will have to input the details of the car they are leasing. The basic functionality of the application includes: creating renter/rentee login account (with associated user/payment/car details), checking the eligibility of the lessee *(age and driving license validity)* and the lessor *(car insurance expiry)*, store all these information in the database tables (in the backend), providing user interface through frontend web tools mentioned above, performing ***CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete)*** operations. Complex functions of the applications include: retrieving user location details through front end and finding out nearest available car stations/lot for the renter (distance measured through road routes, and additional distance filters applied to limit available cars to proximal renteeâ€™s location), storing transactions (if a renter rents a car, *the carId, renterId, payment details, pickup location, pickup and drop off time and date* are all stored).
