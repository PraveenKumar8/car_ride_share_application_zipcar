# UIUC CS 411 Team Project - Database systems
We aim to create a web application very similar to the zipcar.
Any user with valid driver's license can search for the available cars near their locations, customize the kind of car they want (features such as color of the car, type of car, make, model and year of release. 

Additionally, we have a new feature in the web application where users with a car and valid insurance can be able to do business with our webapp by registering and entering the availability of their car whenever it will not be in use and make profits (win-win).
